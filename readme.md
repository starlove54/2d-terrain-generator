This project is a 2D terrain generator that uses perlin noise to create natural-looking landscapes in real-time. The generator is built using the p5.js library and runs in the browser.

## Features

-   Real-time 2D terrain generation using perlin noise.
-   Adjustable terrain size, elevation, and detail level.
-   Interactive camera controls for panning, zooming, and rotating the view.
-   Display of current terrain elevation and seed value.
-   Export of terrain data as a JSON file or image.
-   Support for custom terrain textures and colors.

## How to Use

To use the terrain generator, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The generator will load and display a default terrain with adjustable size and detail settings.
